## âœ§ User Stories

- As a User, I want to be able to open the app page and see a brief description of the game and how to play.
- As a User, I should be able to check the leaderboard that contains the high score with the name of the players.
- As a User, I should have a button to start the game.
  The game should ask the player to enter his/her name.
  The game should give 10 random MC questions to the user with 4 options to each question(only one right answer).
- As a User, I want to have a button to move to the next question after answering the current question.
  The next question button should only appear/activate after answering the question.
- As a User, I should be able to see how many questions I still have to answer(2/10 meaning that I am on the second question).
- As a User, I should be able to see my score after finishing all of the questions.
